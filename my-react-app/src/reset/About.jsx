                <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm <span className="Logo-font">Abigail Wright</span>, the creator of Mum Can Code. As a mother, partner, and carer, I understand the unique challenges that come with balancing family responsibilities and career aspirations. My journey into the world of coding began as a search for flexible work options, but it quickly became a passion and a path to empowerment.</p>
                <p>Through Mum Can Code, I aim to share the transformative power of technology with other mums, helping them discover new opportunities and build the future they envision for themselves and their families.</p>

                        <p>That's when I discovered coding. It was like a light bulb moment. Here was a skill that could open doors to flexible work opportunities, allow me to exercise my creativity, and potentially pave the way to financial stability.</p>

It wasn't easy juggling family responsibilities with my newfound passion, but with each line of code I wrote, I felt myself growing stronger and more confident.</p>
